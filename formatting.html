    <h1>Resume</h1>
    <p><font face="Arial Black" size="4" color="pink">A résumé, sometimes spelled resume, also called a <b>curriculum vitae</b>, is a document created and used by a <u>person to present their background, skills, and accomplishments.</u> Résumés can be used for a<i> variety of reasons,</i> but most often they are used to secure new employment.</font></p>
    <p><strong>In many contexts</strong>, <div>résumé is typically limited to one or two pages of size A4 or letter-size</div> , highlighting only those experiences and qualifications that the author considers most relevant to the desired position. Many résumés contain keywords or skills that potential employers are looking for via applicant tracking systems, make heavy use of active verbs, and display content in a flattering manner.</p>
